backendmycom_db_1 | PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
backendmycom_db_1 | To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:
backendmycom_db_1 | '/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root password 'new-password'
backendmycom_db_1 | '/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root -h  password 'new-password'
backendmycom_db_1 | Alternatively you can run:
backendmycom_db_1 | '/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation'
backendmycom_db_1 | which will also give you the option of removing the test
backendmycom_db_1 | databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
backendmycom_db_1 | strongly recommended for production servers.
backendmycom_db_1 | See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at https://mariadb.com/kb or the
backendmycom_db_1 | MySQL manual for more instructions.

backendmycom_db_1 | PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
backendmycom_db_1 | To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:
backendmycom_db_1 | '/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root password 'new-password'
backendmycom_db_1 | '/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root -h  password 'new-password'
backendmycom_db_1 | Alternatively you can run:
backendmycom_db_1 | '/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation'
backendmycom_db_1 | which will also give you the option of removing the test
backendmycom_db_1 | databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
backendmycom_db_1 | strongly recommended for production servers.
backendmycom_db_1 | See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at https://mariadb.com/kb or the

backendmycom_db_1 | 2021-05-03 08:40:52+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Initializing database files
backendmycom_db_1 | PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
backendmycom_db_1 | To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:
backendmycom_db_1 | '/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root password 'new-password'
backendmycom_db_1 | '/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root -h  password 'new-password'
backendmycom_db_1 | Alternatively you can run:
backendmycom_db_1 | '/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation'
backendmycom_db_1 | which will also give you the option of removing the test
backendmycom_db_1 | databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
backendmycom_db_1 | strongly recommended for production servers.
backendmycom_db_1 | See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at https://mariadb.com/kb or the
backendmycom_db_1 | MySQL manual for more instructions.
backendmycom_db_1 | Please report any problems at https://mariadb.org/jira
